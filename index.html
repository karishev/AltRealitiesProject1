        Your patrol is traveling through the night since it is the only time
        when the titans are inactive. The decision is made to stay within the
        nearby castle, and rest until morning before resuming their patrol. The
        group gathers in an intact room, and attempt to get some rest while
        things are quiet. The senior officers set up a watch on top of the
        tower, and prepare for a long night. As you are on the watch, the castle
        comes under attack by <span style="color: rgb(255, 83, 83);">Titans</span> able to function normally during the night.
        You can see how they slowly gather around the tower and that most likely
        the castle will not withstand their power.

      <p>The only visual I got from development is the one above.</p>
      <p>
        At first, I made the terrain with the forest and some hills. I didn't
        find any assets for free towers, therefore I made one myself using
        Blender. I followed a tutorial and the same way created the stairway
        inside the tower. At that point in time, I thought that doing the main
        position on the lowest level of the tower would be better because of the
        window. However, giving it some thought, the lighting, the moon, and the
        view were better at the top of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, I started to decor the room. I had to make a hole in the floor
        for the staircase using the experimental tool of ProBuilder. Since it
        was experimental, Unity crashed sometimes, so I decide to stay with the
        hole that I have in the final. Afterward, I started to look for assets
        that would help me with the Medieval vibe. After some time, I decided to
        just add weapons, torches, lanterns, a chest, and barrels. Maybe barrels
        could be helped if some titans would climb the walls since in the
        setting there could be 3-meter long titans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thirdly, I added a titan. I got a pretty good-looking titan from assets
        and now had to add the animation. The asset already had a walking
        animation, so I had to add the animation for going back and forth by
        recording the animation. I believe that it is quite good-looking for a
        free asset. From the video above it could be seen that afterward, I made
        some changes in his movements and his size. Also, I changed the
        background, adding mountains and more trees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, I added the sounds. I think that there shouldn't be many sounds,
        so I added only the wind sound and titan walking sound. For the premise
        and the storytelling, I think it is enough. It would be also great to
        add the animation of the trees moving from side to side because of the
        wind, but Unity was already somewhat lagging. I changed the pitch of
        both sounds and adjusted the volume. I also added the VR Rig and it
        worked, but it is better if you are not moving in the game, somehow the
        frames are loading incorrectly in some parts.
      </p>
      <h3>Challenges and Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        This Project is basically an introduction to Unity. Combining all the
        Labs that we had into a project sounded impossible at first, but look
        where we are! However, even though it wasn't impossible, it was still
        hard. The most challenging part was building the tower and its insides.
        No, it wasn't hard to build it in Blender, rather adjusting everything
        in the right position. This scrupulous work took the most time!
      </p>
      <p>
        Another challenging part was to animate the titan. Even though I had an
        idea on how to it and after some time it got easier, in the beginning,
        it was hell. I even thought about doing something else! But everything
        worked out and I got experience in animation and animating!
      </p>
      <p>
        For future projects, it would be nice to make the animations myself for
        a hero and make a logical end of the walk of the titan. Right now it is
        always walking, while it would be creepier if it would stand a bit, look
        around and then continue to walk. In addition, it would be nice to use
        your arms in the game!
